This is a personnel project that I created during the containment period to teach my girlfriend how to play chess, as she was far from me, on the other side of France... It features a server connecting two players who can play both on a local network or online via the internet. Please be advised that it is not a perfect work, as it is my first try at a complete game. The interface is definitely not optimal, as it uses OpenCV to create and display images, rather than a real computer window with buttons, layouts, etc. For example, I could have used Qt, but for this first version, I tried with what I already master: python and OpenCV.
